The Pattaya listing is an hour and a half away from me but I would be available to assist, should you be interested. 

Look forward to hearing from you!

Born and raised in BKK.
I have always loved to travel, my first time on a plane was when a had just turned seven and ever since I fell in love with the world, I describe my self as a ""citizen of the world"" and as such we should not miss the opportunity to explore as many places as we can, but always keeping in mind this : "" The most important thing when traveling is not the destination but our attitude and openness to live new experiences and perceive and respect all different cultures and beliefs "". We live in a world full of diversity and should respect it as is!! 
I love trekking and mountaineering, so I have had the experience to see my country as green as it !! .
I have been an Airbnb host and also a guest, having both experiences I make all my efforts so that those who choose to stay in one of my apartments will have a nice experience enjoy their stay the fullest and also their journey in Thailand,  which has many gastronomic places and cultural events all year round.

Convenience is my top priority when selecting places myself thus all my Airbnb rentals are located in the heart of the city center with very easy access to any public transportations. You would also expect luxury amenities from 5 star hotels (which I collected from my business travels :). There are also coffee/tea, water, snacks inside the room. I greet all my guests in person and offer as many local tips as I can. 

A city is made up of  the people living inside, I want my guests to enjoy not just the tourist spots but also good hospitality and warm welcome from local people.

Solitude, calmness and inspiration is the essence of Aspira D’Andora, a truly unique hideaway yet within easy walking distance of the main artery Sukhumvit, where one can hop on the sky train, or delve into the depths of this vibrant and often chaotic city on the MRT underground train or simply explore the kaleidoscope of modern shopping malls.
The sense of arrival is all embracing, be it the funky artifacts, the nurturing colors or lemongrass aroma, or the vibes all communicates a sense of well-being while one is escorted to the communal lounge for a refreshing Thai welcome drink and formalities. Breakfast is served at the communal lounge where all day beverages are available.
Each of the 23 accommodations is individually designed a story in itself, be it from the imported antique woods that adorn the floor, the 14’’ high quality bed that guarantees the perfect slumber, or the multi-tasking walk-in shower space plotted amidst granite texture color plus the collage of artworks that adorns the walls crowned off with a splattering of lights above the headboard to set your mood. Blazingly swift free Wi-Fi, large LCD TV, refrigerator, complimentary tea/coffee plus multiple ports to re-charge your devices are all just a touch away.
A truly fabulous location offering a broad range of truly international restaurants, lounges, wine bars, coffee shops, noted points include Terminal 21, Emquartier and Emporium shopping malls, a traditional Muay Thai training centre, short stroll to Asoke BTS or Benjakiti Park to keep your jogging or whatever in form makes Aspira D’Andora the perfect choice for a truly inspiring and memorable stay in Bangkok.",within a day,100%,86%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c5194fd6-121e-4bc1-8eec-caab59ec4cbb.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c5194fd6-121e-4bc1-8eec-caab59ec4cbb.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Klong Toey,4,6,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Khet Khlong Toei, Krung Thep Maha Nakhon, Thailand",Khlong Toei,,13.72961,100.56161,Private room in bed and breakfast,Private room,5,,6 baths,5.0,,"[""Smoke alarm"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Hot water"", ""Hangers"", ""First aid kit"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Breakfast"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Exterior security cameras on property"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Wifi"", ""Bed linens"", ""Smoking allowed"", ""Elevator"", ""Shampoo"", ""Shower gel"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Private living room"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Essentials""]",,1,1125,1,1,1125,1125,1.0,1125.0,,t,30,60,90,365,2024-09-25,1,1,0,2024-02-04,2024-02-04,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,f,4,0,4,0,0.13

I was born and live in Bangkok.

I'm a business owner and I love to travel around the world once or twice a year like you guys do - I guess ^^ 

I  love bicycle , swimming, joking, going to gym and reading.

I dream to have my own boutique hotel here in Bangkok, but why do that? because of Airbnb. I think I don't need it anymore. lol 

When I travel to New York or anywhere in the world. I like to use Airbnb
I think it explore the new world of travel experience. You will feel and touch
the local rather than staying at the hotel and of course, cheaper ! 55

This is the best way to learn and feel of that country and people. And it will make you have more experience and best of all the good memory that you can't find if you staying hotel or come with the group tour package. 

Ok, too long story I think.  Wrap it up. I'm here because I'm the one who're the same as you guys. Travelling, eating, sleeping, slow life...etc.

So I find several places that perfect for you guys to stay and easy to access by any mean of transports.  

Believe me , you have to stay with the one that feel like you, not the one that do it for business purpose only. 

I know what you want and love. That's all !!

See ya Soon.

Born and raised in BKK.
I have always loved to travel, my first time on a plane was when a had just turned seven and ever since I fell in love with the world, I describe my self as a ""citizen of the world"" and as such we should not miss the opportunity to explore as many places as we can, but always keeping in mind this : "" The most important thing when traveling is not the destination but our attitude and openness to live new experiences and perceive and respect all different cultures and beliefs "". We live in a world full of diversity and should respect it as is!! 
I love trekking and mountaineering, so I have had the experience to see my country as green as it !! .
I have been an Airbnb host and also a guest, having both experiences I make all my efforts so that those who choose to stay in one of my apartments will have a nice experience enjoy their stay the fullest and also their journey in Thailand,  which has many gastronomic places and cultural events all year round.

She is super helpful and will help you in any problem you have and make sure your stay in koh samui is a most pleasant in any possible way. And i am always very active on message, just text me if you need anything and i will make sure to get back to you soonest as i can. 

I own 4 properties in Bangkok and Koh Samui, which initially had them for my  family vacation. But I'm happy to open them for rent to whoever interest and able to take care of the room same as their own home. Feel free to ask me any questions about the rental or Thailand.

I was born and live in Bangkok.

I'm a business owner and I love to travel around the world once or twice a year like you guys do - I guess ^^ 

I  love bicycle , swimming, joking, going to gym and reading.

I dream to have my own boutique hotel here in Bangkok, but why do that? because of Airbnb. I think I don't need it anymore. lol 

When I travel to New York or anywhere in the world. I like to use Airbnb
I think it explore the new world of travel experience. You will feel and touch
the local rather than staying at the hotel and of course, cheaper ! 55

This is the best way to learn and feel of that country and people. And it will make you have more experience and best of all the good memory that you can't find if you staying hotel or come with the group tour package. 

Ok, too long story I think.  Wrap it up. I'm here because I'm the one who're the same as you guys. Travelling, eating, sleeping, slow life...etc.

So I find several places that perfect for you guys to stay and easy to access by any mean of transports.  

Believe me , you have to stay with the one that feel like you, not the one that do it for business purpose only. 

I know what you want and love. That's all !!

See ya Soon.

Born and raised in BKK.
I have always loved to travel, my first time on a plane was when a had just turned seven and ever since I fell in love with the world, I describe my self as a ""citizen of the world"" and as such we should not miss the opportunity to explore as many places as we can, but always keeping in mind this : "" The most important thing when traveling is not the destination but our attitude and openness to live new experiences and perceive and respect all different cultures and beliefs "". We live in a world full of diversity and should respect it as is!! 
I love trekking and mountaineering, so I have had the experience to see my country as green as it !! .
I have been an Airbnb host and also a guest, having both experiences I make all my efforts so that those who choose to stay in one of my apartments will have a nice experience enjoy their stay the fullest and also their journey in Thailand,  which has many gastronomic places and cultural events all year round.

I am the quiet guest, but I also enjoy a chat, debate and discussion about almost anything. I also love to cook (but not expert) - favourite speciality is definitely Thai food. 

I am very new as a host on Airbnb. I am welcoming and helpful and expect you to enjoy the property as a home, though I do ask you leave it tidy and clean on departure. If you have questions, then do ask me, rather than suffer in silence.

I have been in Nottingham for 2 years and know the city quite well, so if you have questions about where to visit I'm willing to share suggestions.

I am very new as a host on Airbnb. I am welcoming and helpful and expect you to enjoy the property as a home, though I do ask you leave it tidy and clean on departure. If you have questions, then do ask me, rather than suffer in silence.
