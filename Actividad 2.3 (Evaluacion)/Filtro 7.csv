My background is about marketing but I also studied art history and art business in London. Let me know if you're interested in visiting some nice museums or cool galleries in Bangkok. Or we could go to an exhibition opening together if it's the right time :)

I love going to see live musics, mostly jazz. I could name some if you like it too. Sometimes when I'm traveling, I wish I could just chill with my music and relax at my place. So I've got a bluetooth speaker for you guys. Hope you enjoy it!

Movies is my best friend. Doesn't matter if it's a Hollywood blockbuster, an independent production or any kind of niche genre. I like Netflix, so I provide that at my place as well. 

My favorite place at all time, wherever I go or whichever cities I visit, is parks. Unfortunately, there're not many parks in Bangkok. But I'm sure I could recommend some nice parks and you'd love them. 

My favorite thing to do is traveling. Apart from appreciating beautiful places, it broadens my perspective and shapes me how to live my life somehow. Also meeting nice and cool people is  the best. Basically, I find sharing is beautiful. That's why I prefer staying at Airbnb than hotels, and now become a host. 

Hope you have a good time here :) x
